# For SaltConf Session 2 NetOps Attendees

Please allow me to apologize again for the issues with the networking lab on Monday afternoon.  As of this writing, the hands-on lab environments available for the duration of SaltConf are no longer available to continue work.

In the interest of being able to complete the lab objectives, particularly from the point of view of conveying concepts of Salt orchestration in network environments, I encourage you to review the contents of this repository as they pertain to the practical application of Salt in network environments; I will continue to update this repository for as long as interest and activity remain.  For those of you who attended and were unable to complete the lab, I would also like to prepare some documentation and resources so that you can reproduce all of the same lab concepts in a local environment using a utility such as Oracle Virtualbox so as not to incur any cost to you.  My intent is for this documentation to more comprehensively represent the discussions and explanations present in the live interactive lab environment.

If you are interested in receiving this material, please use the AttendeeHub app to exchange contact info with me, as it is my desire for you to have usable material from SaltConf to be able to take back to your workplace, or wherever you may find a use for Salt and its orchestration capabilities.  Thank you all for attending, and for bearing with any of the presentations that lacked any of the polish these topics deserve.
